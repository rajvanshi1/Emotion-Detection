Welcome to the Emotion Detection project! This project aims to detect and analyze emotions from text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Emotion detection has a wide range of applications, from sentiment analysis in social media to customer feedback analysis in businesses. This Read Me file will guide you through the project setup, usage, and important considerations.

Project Structure:

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the emotion detection model. Ensure your dataset is appropriately formatted and placed here.
src/: This directory contains the source code for the emotion detection model. You'll find Python scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models/: This directory stores trained models. After training the model, it will be saved here for later use.
requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project. Make sure to install them before running the code.
